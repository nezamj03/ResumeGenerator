# ResumeGenerator

A major factor in the applicant screening process for tech employers is resume
screening, and ensuring that one’s resume is up to par will greatly increase the chances of
advancing to interviews. A realistic resume can differentiate candidates and open doors for a
multitude of job opportunities. However, creating one from scratch, and molding it to the specific
job opportunity that’s desired is a time consuming task.

Our goal for this machine learning project is to create a model that will generate realistic
resume samples for tech related job postings, given only the desired job title. A major constraint
involved with generating long form text like a resume sample is that the model must generate
human-like, coherent sentences that derive from a specific theme. However, because resumes
follow a set pattern with similar subcategories for information, we are confident that we can use
our model to generate text for subfields in a resume. Such as work experience, project
descriptions, or basic skills.
